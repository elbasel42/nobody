    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutral Tech -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page, scrollable narrative divided into thematic sections. This design choice allows users to explore El's complex story in a guided yet non-linear fashion. The flow starts with an introduction to the author and the premise, moves to the core conspiracy (the 'pp' cabal and their AGI tool), details their plan and alleged historical impact, and concludes with the aftermath and a call for personal reflection. The key interaction is a "rogues' gallery" of the 'pp' members, where clicking on a character reveals their profile in a modal window. This interactive element breaks up the text-heavy narrative, engages the user, and makes the abstract characters more concrete. The structure was chosen to make a dense, speculative story digestible and to highlight its key components logically, prioritizing user understanding over a strict chronological retelling. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The report is entirely qualitative. Goal: Organize & Inform. Method: An interactive character gallery using HTML/CSS/JS. Interaction: Users click on a character card to open a modal with their details. Justification: This transforms a list of names into an engaging discovery process, making the core antagonists memorable. Goal: Organize. Method: A simplified process diagram for "The Plan" built with HTML & Tailwind. Interaction: Static visual aid. Justification: This clarifies the multi-stage plan attributed to 'pp', providing a clear visual anchor for the narrative's logic. Goal: Inform. Method: Thematic text sections with clear headings and introductory paragraphs. Interaction: Reading and scrolling. Justification: This provides the necessary context and detail for the story, with each section having a clear purpose and introduction. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for interactions, Tailwind CSS for layout. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
